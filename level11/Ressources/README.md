Its a lua script runing on the machine localhost on port 5151
that takes a password and hash it but that doesnt output anything so lets forget the password and the hash and focus on hash function and popen it open the output of a command so lets try to give a command to conncat it with echo and redirect it to a file in tmp
password : `getflag` > /tmp/flag
and it works!
