## Level02

ls found a .pcap file pcap short for packet capture we can read its content using `wireshark`

first we need to copy the image into our computer

```
scp level02@ip:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap .
```

Pas sword : ft_wandrâ€¦NDRel.L0L

the hex of the  dots is 7f not printable 

```
78  x    79  y    7a  z    7b  {    7c  |    7d  }    7e  ~    7f del
```

so its del we gonna delete the dots we got
